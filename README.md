## Overview

The Ironless-QDD-Actuator is a low-cost, high-torque, fully 3D-printed quasi-direct-drive actuator for robotics projects. Using a Halbach array for an ironless rotor and a 3D-printed cycloidal planetary gearbox, it delivers up to 29.4Nm of holding torque for \~$70 (with controller). All custom parts are 3D-printable, making it ideal for makers and hobbyists.

### Key Features

- **Low Cost**: \~$40 (actuator), \~$70 (with controller)
- **High Torque**: 29.4Nm holding torque
- **Fully 3D-Printed**: No machining required
- **Ironless Rotor**: Halbach array for high efficiency
- **Zero Backlash**: Cycloidal gearbox for precision
